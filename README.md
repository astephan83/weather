NEED TO DO:

  -Pages for:
    Settings - place to save cities and degree type, possibly others once we figure out the weather library
    Forecast - shows the 5 day forecast of selected city, if none are selected, find the closest one to user's location

2.Database
  -create table to store saves
  - create queries to get/save/update/delete setting options
  
3. Open Weather Map
  - need an account created to get api key
  - figure out different features that may help with finding more ways to personalize settings or possibly another page to show a different weather map type
